This project is an Age Invarient Face Recognition Project.
the motivation behind this project is how difficult it is to identify a missing child over a course of time. Having a picture of the child doesnt help since the child grows and the facial features change over time. 

This project uses facenet model and fgnet dataset.

## downloading the dataset
the dataset can be found on this link.
URL: http://yanweifu.github.io/FG_NET_data/FGNET.zip

I have split the dataset manually placing all images below age 18 in train dataset and above in testing dataset


## output 

Accuracy of 99% achieved on fgnet dataset 
Accuracy of 95~96% achieved on custom dataset
