# minority-report

This project is an Age Invarient Face Recognition Project.
the motivation behind this project is how difficult it is to identify a missing child over a course of time. Having a picture of the child doesnt help since the child grows and the facial features change over time. 

This project uses facenet model and fgnet dataset.
